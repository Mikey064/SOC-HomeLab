# SOC Homelab Project

## Objective

The Security Operations Center Home-Lab project aimed to establish a controlled environment for simulating and detecting cyber attacks. The primary focus was to ingest and analyze logs within a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system, generating test telemetry to mimic real-world attack scenarios. This homelab is designed for a wide array of use cases including centralized logging and monitoring with Elastic Stack, security testing with Mythic and Kali Linux, and simulation of various services like osTicket and RDP-enabled Windows Server environments. The setup allows for practical experimentation and hands-on learning across a variety of platforms and services, to deepen understanding of network security, attack patterns, and defensive strategies.

### Skills Learned

- Advanced understanding of SIEM concepts and practical application.
- Proficiency in analyzing and interpreting network logs.
- Ability to generate and recognize attack signatures and patterns.
- Enhanced knowledge of network protocols and security vulnerabilities.
- Development of critical thinking and problem-solving skills in cybersecurity.

### Tools Used

- Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system for log ingestion and analysis.
- Telemetry generation tools to create realistic network traffic and attack scenarios.

### Description

Homelab Setup Overview

This homelab environment is designed for a diverse range of services, utilizing multiple servers and virtual machines to simulate real-world scenarios and testing environments. The setup integrates various platforms to provide comprehensive monitoring, management, and security testing capabilities.

- Ubuntu Server with Elastic and Kibana:
At the core of the infrastructure, this Ubuntu server runs Elastic Stack (Elasticsearch and Kibana) for centralized logging and real-time data analytics. Kibana provides an intuitive web interface for visualizing and analyzing the logs generated by other services in the homelab, ensuring visibility and insights into system operations.

- Fleet Server (Ubuntu Server):
The Fleet server, also running on Ubuntu, serves as the centralized management platform for Elastic Agent. It orchestrates agent deployments and data collection, facilitating efficient monitoring of the environment while keeping everything in sync.

- Windows Server (RDP Enabled):
A dedicated Windows Server is configured with RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol) enabled for remote administration. This server simulates a Windows-based environment, enabling cross-platform interaction and testing from a different operating system perspective.

- Mythic Server (Ubuntu):
The Mythic server, running on Ubuntu, is used for simulating advanced security testing and red-team operations. Mythic provides a framework for testing various offensive security tools and techniques, acting as a command-and-control server for controlling payloads and running simulations.

- Ubuntu Server:
Another Ubuntu-based server is part of the homelab setup, potentially running additional services or applications for testing, automation, or as a node for various workloads like databases, web services, or application servers.

- osTicket Server (Windows Server):
This server is dedicated to osTicket, an open-source support ticketing system, hosted on Windows Server. It acts as a support management system, handling tickets for incidents, requests, and other service management workflows.

- Kali Linux (Attacker) VM:
The Kali Linux virtual machine is configured as an attack station for penetration testing and security assessments. It includes a range of offensive security tools for conducting vulnerability assessments, exploitation, and network penetration tests within the controlled environment of the homelab.
